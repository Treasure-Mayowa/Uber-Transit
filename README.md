# Uber Transit

by Alchemists for Uber Global Hackathon

## Description
Uber Transit is a Django web application that allows users to seamlessly plan their journey by integrating Uber ridesharing service with the public transit system. It aims to help fix the first-mile, last-mile problem in transportation as well as reduce the environmental impact of ridesharing and make Uber rides more accessible.

## Features
- Uber X Public Transit: See available rides and nearby transit stations in one place, allowing you to seamlessly plan your journey and beat the 'first mile last mile' problem.

- Accessibility Connect: View Uber drivers with accessibility features so you can book a ride that meets your need.

- Multi-User Ridesharing: Why ride alone, when you can ride with multiple users? (new friends + cheaper ride cost). See available space on Uber drivers to ride share with others.

## Future Plans

- Improve the transit suggestion algorithm and provide more journey planning features to users.
- Implement more accessibility features for using Uber Transit itself.
